# Turtle Roy

A Roy programming/learning environment with Turtle Graphics, as in the
Logo programming language.

This is still largely in the works, so move along :) I'll hopefully publish an online
demo soon.

You can of course try it on your own box by running the "run" script.

Thanks to Miikka "arcatan" Koskinen for creating [tryroy](https://github.com/miikka/tryroy), from where I shamelessly stole the Roy browser REPL.

Thanks to Brian McKenna for the [Roy](https://github.com/pufuwozu/roy) language and support.
